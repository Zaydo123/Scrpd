Tailored for developers, data analysts, and businesses, Poof is the perfect tool for competitive analysis, market research, or automated data collection for machine learning models. It equips users with the tools necessary to extract and process web data effortlessly.

## Key Features

- **Versatile User-Agent Generation:** Simulates requests from a wide range of devices and browsers to enhance the success rate in scraping diverse web content.
- **Customizable Request Headers:** Allows crafting of request headers to blend seamlessly into web traffic, minimizing detection and blockage.
- **Robust Proxy Management:** Incorporates advanced proxy handling, including support for HTTP, HTTPS, SOCKS4, and SOCKS5 proxies, to overcome access restrictions and maintain anonymity.
- **Modular Design:** Facilitates easy integration with other tools and customization to meet specific scraping requirements.

## Modules and API Reference

### 1. HeadersGenerator (`headers.py`)

Craft custom headers for HTTP requests to enhance access and reduce blockage likelihood.

```python
class HeadersGenerator:
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        # Initialize with custom parameters

    def generate_headers(self):
        # Generate and return custom headers
```

### 2. UserAgent (`useragents.py`)

Provides a plethora of user agent strings to impersonate various browsers and devices, crucial for effective scraping.

```python
class UserAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialization...

    def get_all(self):
        # Retrieve all user agents

    def get(self, platform=None, quantity=1):
        # Get user agents for a specific platform

    def get_random(self, platform=None, quantity=1):
        # Get random user agent(s) for a given platform
```

### 3. TestUserAgents (`tests.py`)

Ensures the functionality and reliability of the UserAgent module, a critical component of the scraping process.

```python
class TestUserAgents(unittest.TestCase):
    # Suite of unittest methods for UserAgent validation
```

### 4. Proxy Management

Handle and rotate proxies dynamically during web scraping to maintain anonymity and access diverse web resources.

```python
class Proxy:
    # Proxy configuration and management

class ProxyPool:
    # Manage a pool of proxies for efficient rotation and use

class RequestSender:
    # Handle HTTP and HTTPS requests through proxies
```

## Use Cases

- **Market and Competitive Analysis:** Extract and analyze data from competitor websites for strategic insights.
- **Automated Content Aggregation:** Collect and curate content from various web sources for media or research purposes.
- **SEO and Web Analytics:** Perform detailed SEO audits and web content analysis.
- **Data Mining for AI/ML:** Gather extensive datasets required for training sophisticated machine learning algorithms.
